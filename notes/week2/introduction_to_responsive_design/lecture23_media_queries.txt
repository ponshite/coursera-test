Media Queries.
Allow us to group styles togheter and target to devices based on some criteria, like width, height, etc.

Using CSS you have the power to produce a very different layout for the same content.

Media queries allows us to provide different styles for different devices.


Basic Syntax

@media (max-width: 767px) {
    p {
        color:blue;
    }
}

max-width: Media feature, if it results to true, the style will be applied.


max-width:
min-width:
orientation: portrait:
screen:
print:

The most common ones are max-width and min-width
Media queries can be combined using logical operators.

AND
Comma is equivalent to OR. :(

@media (max-width: 1200px) , (max-width: 1300px) {

}

Common Approach

p {                 /* base styles */
    color:blue
}

@media (min-width:1200 px) {
....
}

@media (min-width:992 px) and (max-width:1199px) {
....
}

Make sure not to overlap widths.

Usually, you provide base styling, then change or add to them in each media query.
