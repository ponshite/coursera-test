Class, Id and Elements selectors.

Selectors allows to target a part of the html and apply CSS rules to them.
The browser uses its selector API to target the selector.

Crafting selectors is a great skill to have, since it is not only used by CSS
but Javascript also.

Element Selector.
Will target any element with that name.
Example:

p {
  color:blue;
}

will target:

<p> This will be blue </p>
<p> This will also be blue </p>
Not blue!


Class selector.
HTML allows to classify every single element into any number of classes.
In order to add a class to an HTML element we use the class attribute.
Example

<p class="target"> Will match </p>
<p> Will not match <p>
<p class="target target2"> Will have color blue and Huge Font</p>

Now, we can use a CSS rule, we use a "." to represent a class

.target {
  color: blue;
}

target2 {
  font-size:40px;
}


Id selector.
Ids also allow us to classify a an element in the HTML document, however
they are most restrictive. In contrast to classes, elements can only have
one id, and also, each document can only have one element with that id.
You specify an id using the id attribute.

<p id="unique"> This is some remarkable content </p>
<p> ... </p>


You can select an id using #
#unique {
  font-size:100px;
}


You can also group selectors for example to target p and h1 elements you can use

p, h1 {
  color:blue;
}
