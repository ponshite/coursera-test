Pseudo-class Selectors.

Target elements that cannot be targeted with simple class selectors or
target elements that are related to user interaction with the page.

For example:
Change element if user hovers over an element.


Pseudo classes are targeted via
selector:pseudo-class {

}


There are many pseudo class selectors, but will only focus on 5.

Targeting links states:
Link and visited states
a:link, a:visited {
  text-decoration:none;
}


Hover : When user hover an element.
Active: User click but haven't released.

a:hover, a:active {

}


Select the third child of a li element.
li:nth-child(3) {

}

Select odd children numbers
section div:nth-child(odd) {

}

Select hover style on the fourth child of a div and section.
section div:nth-child(4):hover { }


Summary:
  Pseudo-class selectors are very powerful
  Make sure your selector is still readable. (Simple is better than complex)
