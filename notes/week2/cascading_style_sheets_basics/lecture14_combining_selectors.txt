Element with class selector:

Elements p with class="big"
p.big {

}

<p class="big"> ... BIG .. </p>
<div class="big"> Not big </div>


Child Selector
A selector followed by > and then another selector
article > p {

}

P elements that are DIRECT children from article.

<article>
  <p> .. Selected.. </p>
</article>

<p> Unaffected </p>
<article>
  <div>
    <p> Unaffected </p>
  </div>
</article>


Descendant Selector
Will apply to direct children of another selector

article p {

}

Every p element that is descendant of article
<article>
  <p> .. Affected.. </p>
</article>

<p> Unaffected </p>
