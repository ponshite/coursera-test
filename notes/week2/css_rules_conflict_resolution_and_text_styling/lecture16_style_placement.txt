Style Placement:
Style placement is concerned about how reusable your styles are.. and how
which style the browser will apply.

Style Placement, from most reusable to least reusable.
External file.
The most common place to specify is in an external CSS file.
We do this by using the link element in the head of the HTML document.
We need to use the attribute ref="stylesheet", and href="file to apply"
This is very reusable and it is the recommended way to apply an Style because
every document can share the same style and changing the style across the whole
web page is very easy.


<head>
  <link ref="stylesheet", href="style.css">
</head>

where style.css

p {
  color:black;
}


In the same HTML document.

You can also specify your styling in the same HTML doc directly, without the need
to provide an external file.
You specify an style with the "style" element and it should this element,
should be placed inside the head element.

<head>
  <style>
      p {
        color:red;
      }
  </style>
</head>

In this case, the style can be shared only within the same HTML doc.
Moreover, if there is any CSS rule style conflict between any external files
and the same document, the rules in the same document will be preferred.

Example:
<head>
  <link ref="stylesheet", href="style.css">
  <style>
      p {
        color:red;
      }
  </style>
</head>

where style.css

p {
  color:black;
}

In the previous example, all the p elements will have color red instead of
black.


The least reusable way to style an element is through using the attribute style
in the HTML element itself. This is known as inline styling
Example
<p style="color:blue;">..<p>

This is the least reusable way  but if there is any conflict between styles,
this one will be preferred.
This is only a good idea for quick testing

Summary:
Placing styles inline is great for quick testing.
Real sites styles almost always use external sites.
Head styles are usually there to override external ones.
