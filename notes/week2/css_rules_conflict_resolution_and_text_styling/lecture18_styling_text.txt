Rules for styling text

whatever {
  font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;
}


font-family: Usually a combination of fonts, this is because a font may not
be installed in some user computer, so we add a list of possible font-families.


Serif vs Sans-serifs
Sans -> Straight lines.


color
color: Best way to specify it is through hexadecimal values
#rrggbb

font-weigth:
normal to bold.
Also using numbers.

font-size:
Defaulted to 16px
Pixels are different than points. Think of it as an absolute value. (vs references)

text-transform:
Capitalize, lowercase, etc.

text-align:
Center,right,justify,left. According to the block level element.


Relative font sizes:
Two units of measurement.

Percent and ems.

Percent.
body {
  font-size:120%;  /* 120% of the default value set by browsers */
}

em
Relative to the current size
whatever {
  font-size:2em; /* Increase two times */
}
em have an accumulative effect.
If you increase the size of the view, this value will be respected.
