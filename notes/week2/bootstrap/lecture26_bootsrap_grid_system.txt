Bootstrap grid system basics.


Your bootstrap grid should always be inside a container.
The container can be either "container" or "container-fluid"
"container-fluid" stretches to the whole page.

"container" -> predetermined width.

Then the next element is the class row.
"row" -> Creates horizontal groups of columns. Negative margin to allow row content to align.
"column" -> col-SIZE-SPAN

SIZE: Screen width range identifier (md,lg). Columns will collapse below that width.
SPAN: How many columns (1-12) If more than 12 columns are exceed they will be rolled over to next row



<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12"> Hello World</div>
    </div>
</div>


Using col-xs will guarantee that the behaviour is the same.



Summary:
Structure Bootstrap expects for the grid-based layout.
    -> Needs to include .container (or .container-fluid)
     -> All columns must be inside a row

Size identifier identifies at which breakpoint specified column spans will be ignored
and all elements will collapse

If no other rules apple, specifyin col-xs.. will keep that layout no matter what the size of the screen.
