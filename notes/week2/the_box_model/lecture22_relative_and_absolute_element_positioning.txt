Relative and Absolute Element Positioning.

Precision Position schemes.

Static Positioning
Normal document flow -> Default for all elements, except html.
If you try to apply offsets for any element with static,
it will be ignored.

Relative Positioning
Element is positioned relative to its position in normal
document flow.

Positioning CSS (offset) properties are : top, bottom,
left, right.

The element will not be taken ouy of normal document flow.
    Even is moved, its original spot is preserved,
    even though visualized is somewhere else.


Example:
p {
 position:relative;
 top: 50px;
 left: 50px;
}


The p element will be moved 50px FROM the top and 50 px
FROM the left.
However, the element ghost will remain...
Nothing really changes in the flow, other than changing
the document flow.


You can also use negative values to specificy how to
move the element.


Absolute Positioning

All offsets (top, bottom, left, right) are relative
to the position of the nearest ancestor which has
positioning set on it, other than static.

By default, html is the only element that has non-static
positioning set on it (relative)

Element is taken out of the normal document flow.

Summary:
Static positioning is default for elements except HTML.
Relative positioning offsets the element relative to the normal document
flow position and wont take the element out of the document flow.
Absolute positioning is relative to closest ancestor wjich
positioning set to non-static value (Element is taken out of document flow)
Offsetting the relative container element offsets its contents as well
