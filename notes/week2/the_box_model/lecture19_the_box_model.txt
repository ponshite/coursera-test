Every element is considered a Box.

This box contains more information than the content.
Box:
Margin, border, padding and content.

By default, the browser may set some margin to all the elements.
It is very common to do a CSS reset, that will wipe out the default set by
the browser.

Example:

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}


The padding controls how much space we want to have between the elements.
This is outside the box.

Border controls the border of the element.
Margin controls the space between the border and the actual content.


You can set the width and height of every element.
By default, when you set the width and height of the elements, it only
targets the content! and it won't take into account the padding, and the border.

This is controller by css property called box-sizing.
In CSS3 you can set box-sizing to border-box.
If you use this property set to border-box, the width is guaranteed to be
whatever you specify.
Make sure to always use box-sizing: border-box;

body {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}  -> This doesn't work.. WTF? box-sizing is an special property and won't be
inherited.


* selector
It will select every element in target a property.
Select EVERYTHING!

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}


It can be used in all browsers.


Cumulative margins

  box1 ----- box2

  If box1 margin is set to 40px and box2 margin is set 50px. The margin will be
  90px

  However if you have

  box1
  ---
  ---
  box2

  The margins collapse and the biggest margin will win.

Content overflowing:
Content overflowing can happen when you set a limit on an element box and the
content exceeds that limit.
We can use the CSS property overflow to handle this.

overflow: visible; -> By default
overflow: hidden;
overflow: auto; add scrollbars. Very bad user experience!

Summary:
The box model is an essential topic to undertand.
Prefer box-sizing: border-box;
The universal selector (*)
Cummulative and collapsing margins
Content Overflow.
