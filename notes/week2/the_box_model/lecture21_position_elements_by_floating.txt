Most of the UIs made today are done using floating elements.

When you float an element, the browser takes it out of the regular flow.
When it comes to floated elements, the margin never collapses.

clear: left /* Announces, "nothing should be floating on my left"

You can also say clear:both to ensure it is clear, no matter which side
is taller.

When an element cannot fit into the line, it will be pushed
to another line
