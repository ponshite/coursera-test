Relevant History of HTML

History is relevant to understand the current state of HTML.

Before 1997, there wasn't a technology standard. Browsers pretty much could do
everything they wanted. Invent tags, etc. Pages worked only with one browser.
It was the wild wild west.

In 1997, the World Wide Web Consortium developed the first Standard.
HTML 4.0 & 4.01
The standard was pretty loose, so around 2000, the consortium developed
XHTML 1.0 using a more rigid standard.
The Consortium was trying to push for XHTML 2.0 however, the browsers vendors thought
they were moving too slowly and didn't like the direction of the standard, so they created
another group.
WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Group) (2004)
Much less democratic... One editor to make the final decision.
This group is the one driving HTML
In 2007 both organization decided to start working together.
In 2011 they developed the HTML 5 standard.
This is the current standard.

What matters?
Two organizations.
W3C standard (HTML 5)
WHATWG (HTML evolving)
