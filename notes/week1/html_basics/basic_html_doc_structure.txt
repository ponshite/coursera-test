Should begin with
<!doctype html> (lower or uppercase)

This tells the browser that it should render HTML


In the past, the declaration was pretty complicated.
A lot of pages were not compliant to the standard.
Old pages used this declaration to tell the browsers that they were not compliant.
Not compliant pages were render in the 'quirks' mode.

What you need to know... Don't leave out the doctype declaration.. otherwise
browser will render in 'quirk mode'

HTML tag:
<html>
</html>
This contains all the html document.

Head tag:
<head>
</head>

Contains mostly metadata about the main content. Most common, title,
charset, etc. It is always a good idea to include the charset. The most common one is
"utf-8"
The title tag is required, otherwise html would be invalid.

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title> My Title </title>
</head>


Body tag:
<body>
</body>
Content goes here.


A bare minimum HTML document is the following:
""""""

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Coursera is Cool!</title>
</head>
  <body>
    Coursera is so COOL! I am learning SO much!
  </body>
</html>


""""""


We can use the validator to check the HTML!

One final note:
A browser interpret the html tags from top to bottom!

Summary:
-> Use html version declaration.
-> Basic tags <html> - <head> - <title> - <meta> - <body>
-> Browsers render top to bottom
