HTML Content Models

Content models refers to the default behavior the browser applies to the elements
belonging to that content model and the nesting rules of those elements.

Prior to HTML5, html elements were either block  level or inline elements.
HTML5 splits these two content models into seven models.


Block-Level Elements.
Render to begin on a new line (by default, can be changed via CSS)
May contain inline or other block-level elements within them.
HTML 5 -> Flow Content
Most generic <div>

Inline Elements
Render on the same line (by default)
May only contain other inline elements.
HTML 5 -> Phrasing Content
Most generic <span>


HTML 5 replaces the definitions with 7 models.. why do we still care?
Those models remain pretty practical because they align well with existing
CSS rules

Summary:
Block level vs inline elements.
Still used for the main ideas.
