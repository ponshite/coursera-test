Entity References.

HTML uses some characters for its language.
Need to escape characters to avoid rendering issues.

3 Characters you should always escape:
 <  &lt;
 >  &gt;
 &  &amp;

Example
<h1> Don't be afraid to be &lt; 100% <h1>


Non breaking space
Reference: &nbsp;
The non breaking space will bound words together.

Example
victory&nbsp;&nor&nbsp;defeat


Note:
HTML ignores extra spaces. Some people use non breaking spaces to add
extra spaces, however this is not the way to use it.
Instead, you should use an span element and add some margin.

Another use of html entity references is that they provide the ability
to use characters not available in the keyboard, for example, the copyright
symbol:

Â©  &copy;

There are some other references for characters that are not included
in all the character sets.
For example the character " &quot;

Summary
HTML character entities references avoid rendering issues.
Safeguard against more limited character encoding
Provide characters not available on a keyboard
