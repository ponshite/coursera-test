Creating links.

Links create the web as it is.
The way to create a link is using the anchor element
<a> and providing a value for the key "href"

<a href="same-directory.html"> Link to a file to the same directory. </a>

It is always a good idea to add the title attribute too.
Title is used by screen readers to help visualize impair people.
<a href="same-directory.html" title="my title"> Link </a>

<a> will be used as inline.. even though the <a> is not inline.
<a> is actually inline and block level.

You can include a <div> inside the <a> to create a new line.
<a href="dir">
  <div> Link!
  </div>
</a>


External links:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook page" target="_blank">
 Link to fb
</a>

Normally used with "http" and target="_blank" (This will open a new tab)

Fragment identifier link:
Provide the ability to link to content of the same page.
<ul>
<li> <a href="#section1"> #Section1 <a> </li>
</ul>

<section id="section1">
  Will be directed here.
</section>

Another way without using ids:
<a name="section6"> Section 6 </a>

Identifiers are also used within SPA or Single Page Applications.

Summary:
Internal linking to other pages in the site.
External linking to other web pages
Linking to sections of a single document.
