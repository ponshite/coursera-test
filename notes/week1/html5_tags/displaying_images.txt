Displaying images

You can use the tag img
<img src="image/location">

It is always a good idea to limit the width and height, as well
as the alt attribute.
<img src="image/location" width="400" height="235" alt="super awesome!">

img is an inline element.

Using the width and height tells the browser to reserve the space
for your image, even if the img is not fully loaded.

You can simulate internet being slow in Chrome using
Developer Tools, and then going to the network tab and selecting
throttling.

Also, if your image doesn't load for any reason, your layout will
be messed up.
