Anatomy of an HTML tag

<p> Content </p>
<p> Opening Tag
</p> Closing Tag

p -> Element

Element and tags are terms used interchangeably.


Not every element have a closing tag
Example:
<br>

An element can have attributes, which are key value pairs.
<p id="myId"> </p>
Attribute id
Value myId

No space is allowed after the opening bracket
< p ---> Not allowed
<   /p ---> Not allowed.

Attributes can only be specified on the opening tag.

Even though it is not necessary to add quotes to the value of an attribute,
it is a good practice to use quotes ("") Example:
<p id="myId">

Self closing tag:
<p/> This was allowed in XHTML, however it is not allowed in HTML 5!
Lack of content should be noted with <p></p> and not <p/> !


Summary:

Elements can have key value pairs (attributes)
